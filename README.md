# phineas

**Phineas** is based on the [Bored API](http://www.boredapi.com/) and represents an early attempt to build a graphical application using tkinter. The name comes from the animated television show, *Phineas and Ferb*. Much of the series' humor relies on running gags used in almost every episode, with slight variation. Most episodes follow a pattern: Some incident gives Phineas an idea for a project, and he announces, "Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!"
