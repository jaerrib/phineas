# Phineas

---

## Background

**Phineas** is based on the [Bored API](http://www.boredapi.com/) and represents
an early attempt to build a graphical python application using tkinter.

The name comes  from the animated television show, *Phineas and Ferb*. Much of
the series' humor relies on running gags used in almost every episode, with
slight variation. Most  episodes follow a pattern: Some incident gives Phineas
an idea for a project, and he announces, *"Hey, Ferb, I know what we're gonna do
today!"*

- [ ] Redesign interface with GTK as a means of learning how
- [ ] Make installable as flatpak as a means of learning how
